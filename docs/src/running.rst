Running the Display
===================

The display can be run in three ways; Development, Docker or Kubernetes.

Development
-----------

Refer to :doc:`local_development` for more information on running a local development version.

Docker
------

There is a ``Dockerfile`` as well as the following helper
``Makefile`` commands.

#. To build run ``make build``
#. To run use ``make run``
#. To bring it down again run ``make down``

Refer to the ``Makefile`` as to what the above commands do.

Kubernetes
----------

The Signal Display is part of the `QA Metrics Helm chart`_, so refer there to check usage.
