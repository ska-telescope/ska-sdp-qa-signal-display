Developing the Display
======================

For developing this display locally you need to have a working `NodeJS`_ environment. You will also
need to install `yarn`_ on your machine.

To get a development instance running, do the following on your system:

#. Install the dependencies the dependencies with ``yarn install --frozen-lockfile``
#. (Optional) set the system to use local data by updating the ``env_scripts/env_config`` file, and setting
   ``REACT_APP_USE_LOCAL_DATA:boolean:true``, remember not to commit this change.
#. Run the app in development mode: ``yarn dev``
#. You can now open the app in your browser from `localhost`_.

To use actual data refer to the `Signal API documentation`_.
